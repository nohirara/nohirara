### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm just another virtualized persona. Basically, I do a lot of things:

- Sysop ([administrator](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pengurus)) and social media admin at [Indonesian Wikipedia](https://id.wikipedia.org).
- As non-virtualized persona, I work as social media admin for a company in Jakarta, Indonesia.
- Watching [virtual YouTuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_YouTuber).
- Always trying to love myself and what I'm to do.
